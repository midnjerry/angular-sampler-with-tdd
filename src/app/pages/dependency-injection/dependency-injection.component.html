<h1>Dependency Injection</h1>
<h3><i>Dependency Injection</i> is the technique in which an <i>object</i> receives other <i>objects</i> that it depends
    on.</h3>
<p>Dependency Injection is an extremely important topic to understand because it is the foundation for frameworks and testing.
    This is what you gain by understanding dependency injection:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's easier to design classes for testing.</li>
    <li>It's easier to learn Spring Boot / Angular.</li>
    <li>It's easier to debug Spring Boot / Angular issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to learn dependency injection by studying each keyword found within its definition.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Dependency</li>
    <li>Injection</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand what dependency injection is from a code standpoint and,
    you should be able to identify the different techniques used to inject a dependency. Let's get started!</p>
<h2>What is an object?</h2>
<p>In Java and Javascript, an <i>object</i> refers to a particular <i>instance</i> of a <i>class</i>, where the object can be
    a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.</p>
<p>To simplify this, let's use a metaphor.  A <i>class</i> is a blueprint for how you want to define the states and behavior of an object.
A blueprint is not a house.  It's merely a piece of paper that describes how the house should be built.  A <i>class</i> operates in the same manner.</p>
<p>For us to get a house, we must build it.  You need a construction crew and raw materials.  Once the house is completed, then you can call the finished product
    a house.  In our analogy this is what's considered the <i>object</i>.  It's a working creation defined by the blueprint (the <i>class</i>).  Fortunately for us, 
    a computer can instaneously create an object for us, so we don't have to worry about the manual labor!  We still require raw resources, though, and that comes
    in the form of memory.  An object resides in the memory of the computer and can be called upon within a program to execute a specific task.  For example,
    if we had a Zombie object in memory for our shooter game, the Zombie object would probably hold important information such as hit points, location, sprite information, 
    or inventory items.  The game would need to obtain this information to determine how the zombie interacts with the player.
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at some code.</p>

<codeblock language="language-java" title="Example of an object">{{objectSample1}}</codeblock>
<p></p>
<codeblock language="language-powershell" title="Output">{{objectSampleOutput1}}</codeblock>
<p>Now let's look at what happens when you try to call a method from a class and not an object.</p>
<codeblock language="language-java" title="Calling an instance method from a class">{{objectSampleError1}}</codeblock>
<p></p>
<codeblock language="language-powershell" title="Output">{{objectSampleErrorOutput1}}</codeblock>

<p>Let's revisit our analogy.  Let's say I was developing a subdivision and I had a need to build multiple houses.  I want to save time and cost by not having to redesign
    each house, so I decide to build multiple houses with the same blueprint!</p>
    <p>This is important to understand.  In the game example above, we have 1 Zombie class, but we can have hundreds of Zombie objects for our player to shoot.  Each zombie
        will have information unique to them, such as hit points and location.  All are stored in memory and can be accessed by the game.  Let's look at some code.
    </p>

    <codeblock language="language-java" title="Example of multiple objects">{{objectSample2}}</codeblock>
    <p></p>
    <codeblock language="language-powershell" title="Output">{{objectSampleOutput2}}</codeblock>
    
    <p>
        So to recap:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <i>class</i> is a <i>"blueprint"</i></li>
            <li>An <i>object</i> represents a functional <i>"finished product"</i></li>
            <li>An <i>object</i> is stored in memory.</li>
            <li>You can make multiple <i>objects</i> from one <i>class</i></li>
        </ul>

<p>Now that we have discussed an <i>object</i>, let's discuss what a <i>dependency</i> is.</p>

<h2>What is a dependency?</h2>
<p>A <i>dependency</i> is a <i>class</i> that is used by another <i>class</i>. It's that simple.  If <i>class A</i> uses <i>class B</i> anywhere in its code, 
    then <i>class B</i> is a <i>dependency</i> of <i>class A</i>.
<p>Let's look at some examples below.
</p>

<codeblock language="language-java" title="Dependency Example 1 - As Field variable">{{codeExample1}}</codeblock>
<p></p>
<codeblock language="language-java" title="Dependency Example 2 - As Local variable">{{codeExample2}}</codeblock>
<p>Let's revisit the Zombie analogy and see if we can make a "Weapon" <i>dependency class</i>.  Notice that if you want to utilize some behavior of the <i>dependency class</i>
    then you need an <i>object</i> of that <i>dependency class</i>.</p>
<codeblock language="language-java" title="Dependency Example 3 - As Local variable">{{codeExample3}}</codeblock>
<codeblock language="language-powershell" title="Output">{{objectSampleOutput3}}</codeblock>


<p>
    So to recap:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <i>dependency</i> is a <i>class</i> used in the code of another <i>class</i></li>
        <li>This is typically done by using an <i>object</i> created by the <i>dependency class</i></li>
    </ul>
